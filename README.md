# Maze-using-recursion
This program finds a shortest path from an entrance on the top of a maze to an exit on the bottom using recursion. An array of characters represents a maze: blanks represent corridors, and `+' characters represent walls. Indicate the steps along a path with some other character. The program will read a maze from a data file, identify the path(s) through the maze, and print out each path.
